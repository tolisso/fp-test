Template Haskell homework project for [FP ITMO course](https://github.com/jagajaga/FP-course-ITMO).

## This fork is intended to provide template for `stack new` command

Execute

`stack new fp-homework https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pva701/fp-homework-templates/master/fp-homework.hsfiles`

That's it, you're all set!

Before that, it's better to define several parameters in `~/.stack/config.yaml`:

```yaml
templates:
  params:
    author-name: Put your name here
    author-email: your@email.com
    github-username: your_github
```
